# University Course Registration System\n\n## Team Members\n- Ahmed Amir Ibrahim (202507440) - File Operations\n- Ahmed Hisham Saad (202506915) - Calculations & Statistics\n- Reda Mahmoud Ali (202507258) - Search, Sort & Interface\n\n## Project Description\nThis is a simple university course registration system made for CSAI 101 project.\nStudents can register for courses and admins can manage the system.\n\n## What It Does\n- Admin can view all students and courses\n- Admin can search for students and courses\n- Admin can see statistics\n- Students can view their courses\n- Students can register for new courses\n- Students can drop courses\n- System checks credit limits (12-18 hours)\n- System prevents registering same course twice\n\n## How to Run\n1. Make sure you have Python installed\n2. Run the command: `python main.py`\n3. Login with:\n   - Admin: username=admin, password=admin123\n   - Student: ID=202507440, password=pass123\n\n## Files in Project\n- `main.py` - Main program that runs everything\n- `file_operations.py` - Reads and writes data to files\n- `calculations.py` - Does calculations and checks\n- `interface.py` - Shows menus and searches\n- `data/` - Folder with student and course data\n\n## What We Learned\nWe used concepts from our lectures:\n- Variables and Data Types (Lecture 01)\n- If-else statements and Loops (Lecture 02)\n- Strings and Lists (Lecture 03)\n- Nested conditions (Lecture 04)\n- Nested loops (Lecture 05)\n- Formatted output (Lecture 06)\n- Bubble Sort algorithm (Lecture 07)\n\nPlus some simple extras:\n- Functions (to organize code)\n- File I/O (to save data)\n- Dictionaries (to store data nicely)
